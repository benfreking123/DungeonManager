1. Game Pillars + Non-Goals (1 page)
What the game must feel like (3–7 bullets)
What you’re explicitly not building (important)

2. Gameplay Loop Map (1 page)
A diagram or bullet chain like:
Meta → Select run → Load level → Combat loop → Rewards → Upgrade → Next node → Run end
Include inputs/outputs at each step (what data changes)

3. State Model (the money doc)
Define every state the game can be in (not scenes; actual states):
Boot, MainMenu, RunMap, Combat, Pause, Shop, GameOver, etc.
Define allowed transitions (a simple state machine table)
4. Data Contracts
“What is a Player? Spell? Enemy? Item? LevelNode?”
These are schemas: fields, types, invariants, and who owns them


Goal:
Make a markdown file for each of the pillars.
